\section{Summary}

LBM is a rapidly evolving method which is already an important instrument in the automotive industry. It has shown very good practical results in CFD. It is easy to implement, but it is not always easy to prove its correctness (for example boundary conditions). In comparison to CA, LBM has two different steps - streaming step and collision step. LBM is quasi strictly local scheme. Because of local character of the scheme the LBM can be easily parallelized.
