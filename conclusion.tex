\section{Summary}

LBM is a quickly progressive method which is already a factor in the automotive industry. It has shown very good practical results in CFD. It is easy to implement, but it is not always easy to prove it correctness (for example boundary conditions). 
In comparison to CA, LBM has two different steps - streaming step and collision step. LBM is quasi strictly local scheme. Because of local charachter of the scheme the LBM can be easy parallelize.
