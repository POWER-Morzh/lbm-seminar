Lattice-Boltzmann method (LBM) is a good example of developing new approaches in science. As a relatively young computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method it already has many different implementations and it is a factor in the automotive industry. The advantage of LBM over other conventional CFD methods is in dealing with complex boundaries, incorporating microscopic interactions, and good parallelization of the algorithm.
