Lattice-Boltzmann method are the good example of the developing of new approaches in science. As relatively young computational fluid dynamics methods it has already many different implementations and is a factor in the automotive industry. The advantage of LBM over other conventional CFD methods, is in dealing with complex boundaries, incorporating microscopic interactions, and good parallelization of the algorithm.
